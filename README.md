yumbootstrap
============

yumbootstrap is a tool for installing Yum-based distributions (Red Hat,
CentOS, Fedora) in a chroot directory. Idea behind it is stolen from Debian's
debootstrap. It's planned for yumbootstrap to work along with templates for
`lxc-create`.

There is another project of similar purpose:
[Rinse](http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/rinse/), but seems unmaintained and
I generally didn't like its architecture and configuration.
